                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This project implements a sophisticated AI Agent Orchestration System based on the <strong>SPARC</strong> 
                    (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology. It leverages advanced 
                    <strong>Cognitive Triangulation</strong> for verification, a <strong>RULER-based</strong> quality evaluation
                    system, and a suite of specialized domain agents to automate and manage complex software development workflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The core purpose is to coordinate multiple specialized AI agents to collaboratively design, implement, 
                    test, and validate software projects, ensuring alignment with user intent at every stage of development.

                <h2>Key Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SPARC Methodology:</strong> A structured five-phase workflow from specification to completion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Triangulation:</strong> Multi-stage verification to ensure stakeholder alignment and prevent requirement drift.</li>
                    <li><strong>RULER Quality Evaluation:</strong> An LLM-as-Judge system to rank and select optimal implementation strategies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specialized Agents:</strong> 46 expert agents for tasks ranging from financial logic auditing to performance validation.</li>
                    <li><strong>State Management:</strong> A robust SQLite-based memory system for comprehensive project history and context awareness.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>To get started with the orchestrator, you need to have Python and Git installed. Clone the repository and install the required tools:</p>
                <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/jayfoeelite/custom-agents-orchestrator.git
cd custom-agents-orchestrator
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt</code></pre>
                <p>You can then begin interacting with the agent modes through a compatible AI coding assistant like RooCode.</p>
